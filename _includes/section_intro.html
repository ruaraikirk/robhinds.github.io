			Hi!<br><br>Thanks for viisting my GitHub CV. My name is Ruaraí Kirk and I am currently based in Dublin, Ireland.
			<br><br>My background is in Electronic Engineering, having spent 4 years working for Intel and most recently with KPMG in the area of R&D Tax Credits, primarily with clients in the software industry, as well and in electronics and manufacturing.
			<br><br>I am in the process completing a Higher Diploma in Computing at TUD (previously DIT), with a strong focus this year on OOP (Java, C#) covering topics such as SOLID design principles, concurrency and threading, as well as web applications and Android application development. 
			<br><br>I am also currently undertaking a six month Software Development internship with SAP.
			<br><br>The purpose of this GitHub CV is to demonstrate some examples of projects that I have worked on, and showcase some of the technologies that I have used.
