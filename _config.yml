   description: Currently working in the interesting field of the Research and Development ('R&D') tax credit and relief scheme in Ireland. The R&D tax credit is a unique area of tax that requires understanding of science, technology, accounting, and taxation. The R&D tax credit is an incentive to encourage companies to carry out R&D activities and to attract multinationals to invest in Research, Development and Innovation ('R&D&I'). The R&D tax program is quite new in Ireland (2004). My technical knowledge coupled with my willingness to diversify, has given me the opportunity to work with, and be specifically trained by, expert professionals in the area of the R&D tax credit. Experience gained across a range of industry sectors, such as manufacturing, electronic engineering and software development, advising multinational PLCs, LC, SMEs and start-up companies in Ireland
